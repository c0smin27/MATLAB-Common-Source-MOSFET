# MATLAB â€“ Common-Source MOSFET Simulation

This project implements a MATLAB application that simulates the behavior of a common-source MOSFET transistor. <br>
Based on the user-defined parameter values, the input and output resistances are calculated, and both AC and DC output voltages are plotted. <br>
